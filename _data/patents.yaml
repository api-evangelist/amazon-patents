  name: Securing results of privileged computing operations
  summary: ""
  abstract: A formalized set of interfaces (e.g., application programming interfaces
    (APIs)) is described, that uses a security scheme, such as asymmetric (or symmetric)
    cryptography, in order to secure the results of privileged operations on systems
    such as the operating system (OS) kernel and/or the hypervisor. The interface
    allows a public key to be included into a request to perform a privileged operation
    on a hypervisor and/or kernel. The kernel and/or hypervisor use the key included
    in the request to encrypt the results of the privileged operation. In some embodiments,
    the request itself can also be encrypted, such that any intermediate parties are
    not able to read the parameters and other information of the request.

  name: Personalized content insertion into media assets at the network edge
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques for inserting advertising content and other personalized information
    into media assets are described. The techniques involve inserting personalized
    ads and other content into media assets as a server at the content delivery network
    (CDN) point-of-presence (POP) is performing the individualized encoding of the
    file on-the-fly. The ads and other content can be personalized based on the user's
    purchasing habits, user's location (geographic, GPS, IP location, etc.), the content
    in the media file and the like. In addition, the ads can be inserted into specific
    parts of the video (i.e. key frames, key slices, etc.) because the CDN node is
    actually transcoding the content and thus can insert the ads into the content
    in its own native format. For example, ads can appear as part of the video itself,
    different language subtitles can be integrated into the video based on the location
    of the user, and the like.

  abstract: Data can be processed in parallel across a cluster of nodes using a parallel
    processing framework. Using Web services calls between components allows the number

    with a queuing service to distribute jobs to nodes as the nodes have capacity,
    such that jobs can be performed in parallel as quickly as the nodes are able to
    process the jobs. Data can be loaded efficiently across the cluster, and levels

  abstract: A system that implements a data storage service may store data on behalf
    of clients in multiple replicas stored on respective computing nodes. The system
    may employ a single master failover protocol, usable when a replica attempts to
    become the master replica for its replica group. Attempting to become the master
    replica may include acquiring a lock associated with the replica group, and gathering
    state information from other replicas in the group. The state information may
    indicate whether another replica supports the attempt (in which case it is included
    in a failover quorum) or stores more recent data or metadata than the replica
    attempting to become the master (in which case it is removed from the replica
    group). If replicas are removed from the group, they may re-join later or new
    replicas may be added. If the failover quorum includes enough replicas, the replica
    assumes mastership for the group.

    they aim to reduce provisioned storage capacity or reduce throughput capacity
    on a storage device or logical volume, whether they conflict with each other,
    whether the total number of partitions (or replicas thereof) involved in partition
    management at any given time exceeds a pre-determined limit, or whether they were

    import/export slots, that logically connect two or more virtual tape libraries.
    Virtual media changers of the virtual tape libraries can be commanded, as if physical
    media changers, to virtually move virtual media, such as virtual tapes, within
    and among the virtual tape libraries. By moving a virtual medium to a connected
    element, the virtual medium can be virtually moved from one virtual tape library
    to another.

  name: Processing event messages for user requests to execute program code
  summary: ""
  abstract: A service manages a plurality of virtual machine instances for low latency
    execution of user codes. The service can provide the capability to execute user
    code in response to events triggered on an auxiliary service to provide implicit
    and automatic rate matching and scaling between events being triggered on the
    auxiliary service and the corresponding execution of user code on various virtual
    machine instances. An auxiliary service may be configured as an event triggering
    service to detect events and generate event messages for execution of the user
    codes. The service can request, receive, or poll for event messages directly from
    the auxiliary service or via an intermediary message service. Event messages can
    be rapidly converted to requests to execute user code on the service. The time
    from processing the event message to initiating a request to begin code execution
    is less than a predetermined duration, for example, 100 ms.

  name: Utilizing excess resource capacity for transcoding media
  summary: ""
  abstract: A transcoding service is described that is capable of utilizing the excess
    capacity of the computing resources of a service provider. The customer of the
    transcoding service can submit a bid price for completing the transcodes. As long
    as the specified price exceeds the fluctuating price of the unused resource instances,
    the transcoding service will execute the job on the unused instance(s). If the
    price of the unused resource instances exceeds the customer's bid, the transcoding
    process stops. The transcoding service may pause the transcoding when the dynamically
    fluctuating price of the unused resource exceeds the customer's bid and then resume
    when the price falls back down. Users can specify constraints for transcoding,
    such as timeframes during which the transcode must be completed, a total price
    for completing transcoding or priorities of the media files. The system can automatically
    optimize the utilization of the resource instances according to the constraints.

  name: Isolating tenants executing in multi-tenant software containers
  summary: ""
  abstract: Technologies are described herein for isolating tenants executing in a
    multi-tenant software container. Mechanisms for resource isolation allow tenants
    executing in a multi-tenant software container to be isolated in order to prevent
    resource starvation by one or more of the tenants. Mechanisms for dependency isolation
    may be utilized to prevent one tenant executing in a multi-tenant software container
    from using another tenant in the same container in a manner that requires co-tenancy.
    Mechanisms for security isolation may be utilized to prevent one tenant in a multi-tenant
    software container from accessing protected data or functionality of another tenant.
    Mechanisms for fault isolation may be utilized to prevent tenants in a multi-tenant
    software container from causing faults or other types of errors that affect other
    tenants executing in the same software container.

  summary: ""
  abstract: A computing resource monitoring service receives metrics data from customer
    applications and resources provided by a computing resource service provider.
    The metrics data is stored in observation journals within an observation journal
    logical data container. A map reduce processor is configured to obtain a current
    index file, the index file comprising a mapping of the metrics data stored within
    a metric store and a manifest comprising a listing of all processed observation
    journals. The map reduce processor may process the unprocessed observation journals
    to separate, sort and aggregate metrics data stored therein. This process generates
    index artifacts that may be merged with the index file, in an append-only process,
    to generate a new index file. An index pointer may be modified such that the map
    reduce processor refers to a different version of the index file in order to support
    roll back of metrics data.

  name: Automated reconfiguration of shared network resources
  summary: ""
  abstract: A resource manager can adjust the amount of capacity in each of a plurality
    of resource pools using a combination of proactive and reactive approaches. Targets
    such as an amount of total capacity and an amount of free capacity can be forecast
    and periodically compared against actual capacity and usage of the pools. A pool
    balancing algorithm can be used to shift capacity among pools as needed, in order
    to provide the targeted amount of capacity for each pool before the capacity is
    needed. When actual usage varies sufficiently from the forecasted usage on which
    the targets are based, the resource manager can react by reconfiguring resources
    as needed.

  name: Backup of volatile memory to persistent storage
  summary: ""
  abstract: Approaches for automatically backing up data from volatile memory to persistent
    storage in the event of a power outage, blackout or other such failure are described.
    The approaches can be implemented on a computing device that includes a motherboard,
    central processing unit (CPU) a main power source, volatile memory (e.g., random
    access memory (RAM)), an alternate power source and circuitry (e.g., a specialized
    application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) for performing the backup of volatile
    memory to a persistent storage device. In the event of a power failure of the
    main power source, the alternate power source is configured to supply power to
    the specialized ASIC for backing up the data in the volatile memory. For example,
    when power failure is detected, the ASIC can read the data from the DIMM socket
    using power supplied from the alternate power source and write that data to a
    persistent storage device.

  name: Failure-decoupled volume-level redundancy coding techniques
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques described and suggested herein include systems and methods
    for storing, indexing, and retrieving original data of data archives on data storage
    systems using redundancy coding techniques. For example, redundancy codes, such
    as erasure codes, may be applied to archives (such as those received from a customer
    of a computing resource service provider) so as allow the storage of original
    data of the individual archives available on a minimum of volumes, such as those
    of a data storage system, while retaining availability, durability, and other
    guarantees imparted by the application of the redundancy code. Sparse indexing
    techniques may be implemented so as to reduce the footprint of indexes used to
    locate the original data, once stored. The volumes may be apportioned into failure-decorrelated
    subsets, and archives stored thereto may be apportioned to such subsets.

  name: Validating changes to attributes for computing resources
  summary: ""
  abstract: Requests to change attributes of servers or other computing resources
    can be validated by a veto service. For example, the veto service can receive
    requests to register for notification of changes to an attribute for a server,
    send a notification of a pending change to the attribute to each of a plurality
    of services, determine a response to the notification for each service, and based
    on the responses decide whether to allow or deny the pending change to the attribute.
    The responses from the notified services can be received responses or default
    responses.

  name: Distributed performance evaluation framework
  summary: ""
  abstract: A distributed performance evaluation framework provides functionality
    for evaluating the availability, reliability, and scalability of a network-based
    service. The framework includes a control and reporting tier and a load-generating
    tier. The control and reporting tier provides a control interface through which
    a request to evaluate the performance of a service may be received. In response
    to receiving such a request, the control and reporting tier creates a load-generating
    job for use by the load-generating tier. Load-generating instances in the load-generating
    tier are configured to perform the load-generating job by executing instances
    of a load-generating plug-in configured to generate requests to the service. The
    load-generating instances also periodically provide data regarding the status
    of each load-generating job to the control and reporting tier.

  name: Long term encrypted storage and key management
  summary: ""
  abstract: An encryption key not accessible outside a data storage device can be
    used to encrypt data stored in that device. The received data may have been encrypted
    under an external key, such as a key associated with a customer of a data storage
    service. Upon receiving the data encrypted under the external key, the data can
    be decrypted using a copy of the external key and then re-encrypted, inside the
    data storage device, using the internal key. If the external key is to be rotated,
    the stored data does not need to be modified as the data can be decrypted using
    the internal key and then re-encrypted using the new external key in response
    to an authorized request for the data after the change to the new external key.
    Such an approach provides near instant key rotation while not having to re-encrypt
    data under the new key unless requested.

  abstract: Techniques are described for providing client computing nodes with enhanced
    access to remote network-accessible services, such as by providing local capabilities
    specific to the remote services. In at least some situations, access to remote
    services by a client computing node may be enhanced by automatically locally performing

    that are sent between the client computing node and the remote service and/or
    to improve the efficiency by the remote service of processing communications from
    the client computing node. As one example, a node manager system local to a client
    computing node may perform authentication of communications sent by the client
    computing node to a remote service and/or may perform other activities specific
    to the remote service, so that the remote service does not need to perform the
    authentication and/or other performed activities for the communications.

  name: Virtual requests
  summary: ""
  abstract: A first request from a client using a first protocol is translated into
    one or more second requests by a servicer using a second protocol through a virtual
    request using the first protocol. A client may use parameters of the first protocol
    to pass virtual request components to the servicer. A format agreement between
    the client, servicer and/or authentication service may allow the servicer and/or
    authentication service to translate the virtual request components over the first
    protocol to one or more second requests using the second protocol. Virtual request
    components may prove the authenticity of the virtual request received by the servicer
    to an authentication service. Once satisfied the virtual request is valid, the
    authentication service may issue a credential to the servicer to send the one
    or more second requests to an independent service. Virtual requests may be included
    in various protocols, including credential-based protocols and certificate exchange-based
    protocols.

  name: Trace backtracking in distributed systems
  summary: ""
  abstract: Methods and systems for trace backtracking are disclosed. In response
    to receiving a request from an upstream component at a downstream component, a
    trace is initiated at the downstream component. A response to the request is sent
    from the downstream component to the upstream component. The response comprises
    trace metadata. Trace data is generated at the upstream component in response
    to receiving the trace metadata at the upstream component. The trace data describes
    an interaction between the upstream component and the downstream component. A
    call graph is generated based on the trace data. The call graph comprises a call
    path between the upstream component and the downstream component.

  name: Wear leveling and management in an electronic environment
  summary: ""
  abstract: Workloads can be intelligently placed across a group of resources in order
    to attempt to balance or otherwise manage the level of wear among various components
    of those resources. Devices such as solid state drives or other NAND-type devices
    can have a limited number of operations that can be performed before those devices
    become unreliable, such that it can be desirable to monitor the wear level of
    each of these devices. As it can be easier to manage resources with similar wear
    levels for large groups of resources, it can be desirable to attempt to level
    the relative amount of wear among at least groups of these resources. Attempts
    can be made to level across a fleet or resources, within pools of resources, and/or
    within the resources themselves, such as where a server includes multiple devices
    with potentially different wear levels, such as multiple NAND-type devices.

  name: Virtual communication endpoint services
  summary: ""
  abstract: Customers can utilize resources of a multi-tenant environment to provide
    one or more services available to various users. In order to simplify the process
    for these customers, the multi-tenant environment can include an infrastructure
    wherein a portion of the resources provide an authentication and/or authorization
    service that can be leveraged by the customer services. These resources can logically
    sit in front of the resources used to provide the customer services, such that
    a user request must pass through the authorization and authentication service
    before being directed to the customer service. Such resources can provide other
    functionality as well, such as load balancing and metering.

  name: Provisioning virtual resource on a server based on label associated with virtual
    resource and servers
  summary: ""
  abstract: Virtual resource provisioning may be enhanced by coloring virtual resource
    instances and/or underlying implementation resources. Particular resource colors
    may be associated with particular treatments during allocation of implementation
    resources to virtual resources. There may be different types of colors corresponding
    to different types of allocation treatment. Exclusory colors may be utilized to
    reduce clustering of virtual resources with respect to implementation resources.
    Assignment of exclusory colors to virtual resources can help strike a balance
    between lower costs through efficient implementation resource utilization and
    higher fault tolerance through spreading across an available implementation resource
    pool. Inclusive colors may be utilized to require and/or prefer allocation of
    virtual resources to implementation resources painted with the inclusive color.
    Proximity colors may be utilized to enhance a computational performance of a set
    of virtual resources. Proximity colors may be associated with proximity specifications
    that define proximity in implementation resource networks.

  abstract: Methods and apparatus for providing identity and access management-based
    access control for connections between entities in virtual (overlay) network environments.
    At the encapsulation layer of the overlay network, an out-of-band connection creation
    process may be leveraged to enforce access control and thus allow or deny overlay
    network connections between sources and targets according to policies. For example,
    resources may be given identities, identified resources may assume roles, and
    policies may be defined for the roles that include permissions regarding establishing
    connections to other resources. When a given resource (the source) attempts to
    establish a connection to another resource (the target), role(s) may be determined,
    policies for the role(s) may be identified, and permission(s) checked to determine
    if a connection from the source to the target over the overlay network is to be
    allowed or denied.

    that include multiple load balancers each serving multiple nodes. In the connection
    redistribution method, each node estimates a connection close rate, which may
    be based on an estimation of the percentage of the overall client traffic received
    by the respective load balancer that is being handled by the node. The node generates
    close requests for connections between the respective load balancer and clients
    according to the connection close rate. The node sends the close requests to its
    load balancer, which forwards the close requests to the appropriate clients. Upon
    receiving a close request, a client may close the connection(s) indicated by the
    request, obtain a public IP address for a load balancer, and initiate new connection(s)
    to the respective load balancer via the public IP address.

  name: System and method for implementing a scalable data storage service
  summary: ""
  abstract: A system that implements a scalable data storage service may maintain
    tables in a non-relational data store on behalf of clients. The system may provide
    a Web services interface through which service requests are received, and an API
    usable to request that a table be created, deleted, or described; that an item
    be stored, retrieved, deleted, or its attributes modified; or that a table be
    queried (or scanned) with filtered items and/or their attributes returned. An
    asynchronous workflow may be invoked to create or delete a table. Items stored
    in tables may be partitioned and indexed using a simple or composite primary key.
    The system may not impose pre-defined limits on table size, and may employ a flexible
    schema. The service may provide a best-effort or committed throughput model. The
    system may automatically scale and/or re-partition tables in response to detecting
    workload changes, node failures, or other conditions or anomalies.

  name: Approaches for managing virtual instance data
  summary: ""
  abstract: A resource provider is able to manage instance data associated with virtual
    compute instances running in the resource provider environment. For example, when
    provisioning a compute instance, the resource provider can obtain data associated
    with the compute instance and can store this data, for example, in a data store.
    The resource provider can act as a centralized repository of such data for some
    or all instances that are running in the resource provider environment. Entities
    (e.g., users or other compute instances running in the resource provider environment)
    can query the resource provider to perform various operations (e.g., read, modify,
    duplicate) on the data being managed by the resource provider for the various
    compute instances. Any changes to the data for a compute instance, for example,
    by a user, the compute instance, or a different compute instance, can be saved
    by the resource provider and propagated to the compute instance.

    A system may include a storage medium configured to store instructions and one
    or more processors configured to access the storage medium. The instructions may
    be executable by at least one of the processors to implement a web services access
    control system (ACS) configured to receive requests. Each request specifies an

  name: Multi-tenant throttling approaches
  summary: ""
  abstract: An opportunistic throttling approach can be used for customers of shared
    resources in a multi-tenant environment. Each customer can have a respective token
    bucket with a guaranteed fill rate. When a request is received for an amount of
    work to be performed by a resource, the corresponding number of tokens are obtained
    from, or charged against, a global token bucket. If the global bucket has enough
    tokens, and if the customer has not exceeded a maximum work rate or other such
    metric, the customer can charge less than the full number of tokens against the
    customer's token bucket, in order to reduce the number of tokens that need to
    be taken from the customer bucket. Such an approach can enable the customer to
    do more work and enable the customer's bucket to fill more quickly as fewer tokens
    are charged against the customer bucket for the same amount of work.

  name: Preventing attacks that rely on same-page merging by virtualization environment

  summary: ""
  abstract: In a virtualization environment, a guest process may protect itself from
    potential timing side-channel attacks by other guest processes on the same host
    machine by taking steps to avoid same-page merging for memory pages that it accesses.
    Pages that include critical code (e.g., cryptographic functions) or sensitive
    data (e.g., cryptography keys) may be designated as important pages to protect
    from such attacks. A placeholder location of a specified size for storing a non-deterministic
    value (e.g., a random or pseudorandom number) may be inserted into these pages
    when instantiated, making them unlikely to match pages accessed by other guests.
    Therefore, the host machine may be unlikely to identify them as pages for which
    there is a same-page merging opportunity. The values in the placeholder locations
    may be updated periodically or in response to certain events (e.g., context switches
    between guests or the detection of same-page merging).

  name: Providing notification of computing resource availability for on-demand allocation
  summary: ""
  abstract: Technologies are described herein for providing notifications of computing
    resource availability for on-demand allocation. A resource request is received
    from a requesting application indicating the type, size, number, and other parameters
    of the computing resources desired. Upon determining that the requested computing
    resources are not immediately available, suitable alternative resources are determined
    based on the parameters of the requested resources. The availability of computing
    resources at the service provider is monitored, and when the requested resources
    or suitable alternatives become available, the requesting application is sent
    one or more resource availability notifications describing the available resources.
    The requesting application may then allocate the available resources from the
    service provider on-demand.

  abstract: A user may utilize a set of credentials to access, through a managed directory
    service, one or more services provided by a computing resource service provider.
    The managed directory service may be configured to identify one or more policies
    applicable to the user. These policies may define the level of access to the one
    or more services provided by the computing resource service provider. Based at
    least in part on these policies, the managed directory service may transmit a
    request to an identity management system to obtain a set of temporary credentials
    that may be used to enable the user to access the one or more services. Accordingly,
    the managed directory service may be configured to enable the user, based at least
    in part on the policies and the set of temporary credentials, to access an interface,
    which can be used to access the one or more services.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Some embodiments facilitate high performance packet-processing by enabling
    one or more processors that perform packet-processing to determine whether to
    enter an idle state or similar state. As network packets usually arrive or are
    transmitted in batches, the processors of some embodiments determine that more
    packets may be coming down a multi-stage pipeline upon receiving a first packet
    for processing. As a result, the processors may stay awake for a duration of time
    in anticipation of an incoming packet. Some embodiments keep track of the last
    packet that entered the first stage of the pipeline and compare that with a packet
    that the processor just processed in a pipeline stage to determine whether there
    may be more packets coming that need processing. In some embodiments, a processor
    may also look at a queue length of a queue associated with an upstream stage to
    determine whether more packets may be coming.

  name: Suspending noise cancellation using keyword spotting
  summary: ""
  abstract: Aspects of the disclosure provide suspension of noise cancellation at
    a noise-cancelling device using keyword spotting. In one aspect, a predetermined
    word or phrase can be spotted within an utterance received at the noise-cancelling
    device, and in response, noise cancellation can be suspended or otherwise terminated.
    The predetermined word or phrase can be specific to an end-user that utilizes
    the noise-cancelling device and/or a person that interacts with the end-user.
    In another aspect, interaction between an operator and the noise-cancelling device
    can be monitored after noise cancellation is suspended, and based at least on
    such interaction, a model for keyword spotting can be refined. In certain aspects,
    noise cancellation at the noise-cancelling device can be suspended or otherwise
    terminated in response to receiving a suspension directive via an electronic non-audio
    signal, for example, from a peripheral device. In other aspects, the noise-cancelling
    device can resume noise cancellation in response to a control signal.

  name: Distributed caching system
  summary: ""
  abstract: Embodiments of a distributed caching system are disclosed that cache data
    across multiple computing devices on a network. In one embodiment, a first cache
    system serves as a caching front-end to a distributed cluster of additional cache
    systems. The first cache system can distribute cache requests to the additional
    cache systems. The first distributed caching system can also serve as a cache
    server itself, by storing data on its own internal cache. For example, the first
    cache system can first attempt to find a requested data item on the internal cache,
    but, if the lookup results in a cache miss, the first cache system can search
    the additional cache systems for the data. In some embodiments, the first cache
    system is configured to multiplex requests to each additional cache system over
    a single negotiated streaming protocol connection, which allows for network efficiencies
    and faster detection of failure.

    of a resource queue, it may receive a resource token for a respective constrained
    resource. Once the request has collected resource tokens for each of the constrained
    resources on which it depends, the request may be passed to a service request
    queue that maintains a queue of requests of a particular type. Requests in the

  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques for providing friction-free transactions using geolocation
    and user identifiers are described herein. These techniques may ascertain a user's
    location based on a location of a mobile device. A transaction between the user
    and a merchant may be completed with zero or minimal input from the user based
    on the geolocation of the mobile device and the user identifiers. In some implementations,
    a transaction initiated earlier is completed when the mobile device arrives at
    the merchant. Additionally, a parent-child or similar relationship may be established
    between multiple devices. Security on the mobile device based may be provided
    by biometric identification and calculation of variance from regular movement
    patterns. Advertisements may be sent to the mobile device based on bids from merchants
    near to the mobile device. Promotions may be sent to the mobile device when more
    than a threshold number of mobile devices are located at the same merchant.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Approaches to enable the configuration of computing resources for executing
    virtual machines on behalf of users to be cryptographically attested to or verified.
    When a user requests a virtual machine to be provisioned, an operator of the virtualized
    computing environment can initiate a two phase launch of the virtual machine.
    In the first phase, the operator provisions the virtual machine on a host computing
    device and obtains cryptographic measurements of the software and/or hardware
    resources on the host computing device. The operator may then provide those cryptographic
    measurements to the user that requested the virtual machine. If the user approves
    the cryptographic measurements, the operator may proceed with the second phase
    and actually launch the virtual machine on the host. In some cases, operator may
    compare the cryptographic measurements to a list of approved measurements to determine
    whether the host computing device is acceptable for hosting the virtual machine.

  summary: ""
  abstract: A bloom filter is generated for efficient query processing for unsorted
    data in a column of a columnar database. Bloom filters represented as bitmaps
    are generated for data blocks storing data for a column of a columnar database
    table. An indication of a query directed toward the column is received and the
    bloom filter for each data block is examined to determine which ones of the data
    blocks do not need to be read in order to service the query for the select data.
    Data is then read from the data blocks storing data for the column excepting the
    ones which do not need to be read.

  name: Data security with a security module
  summary: ""
  abstract: A security module securely manages keys. The security module is usable
    to implement a cryptography service that includes a request processing component.
    The request processing component responds to requests by causing the security
    module to perform cryptographic operations that the request processing component
    cannot perform due to a lack of access to appropriate keys. The security module
    may be a member of a group of security modules that securely manage keys. Techniques
    for passing secret information from one security module to the other prevent unauthorized
    access to secret information.

  name: Text detection using features associated with neighboring glyph pairs
  summary: ""
  abstract: A multi-orientation text detection method and associated system is disclosed
    that utilizes orientation-variant glyph features to determine a text line in an
    image regardless of an orientation of the text line. Glyph features are determined
    for each glyph in an image with respect to a neighboring glyph. The glyph features
    are provided to a learned classifier that outputs a glyph pair score for each
    neighboring glyph pair. Each glyph pair score indicates a likelihood that the
    corresponding pair of neighboring glyphs form part of a same text line. The glyph
    pair scores are used to identify candidate text lines, which are then ranked to
    select a final set of text lines in the image.

  abstract: Improved caching mechanisms are presented herein for use with an in-memory
    distributed cache and, potentially, other types of caches. One mechanism permits
    cache clients to wait on a cache key being fetched by one or more other cache
    clients. When the cache key arrives at the cache, the waiting cache clients may
    be called back with the cache key. Another mechanism allows a service to push
    changed values directly into a distributed cache. Yet another mechanism allows
    the storage of information in a cache that defines dependencies between cached
    values. The dependency information can be utilized to invalidate cache values
    that are dependent upon other cached values that have been invalidated.

  name: Dynamic isolation of shared resources
  summary: ""
  abstract: Shared resources can be isolated such that abuse of the resource by one
    user does not significantly affect the use of that resource by another user. A
    combination of access and flow control can be used, wherein a control gateway
    or other such component sits along a path between the user and the resource, such
    that the user obtains connections or access to the resource through the gateway.
    In this way, the gateway can control aspects such as the number of concurrent
    threads or channels granted to a user, as well as any delay in providing these
    threads or channels to the resource. A closed feedback loop can provide real-time
    information such that adjustments can be made dynamically, preventing abuse by
    users while also preventing the resource allocations from being underutilized.

  name: Managing external communications for provided computer networks
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques are described for providing managed computer networks. In some
    situations, the techniques include managing communications for computing nodes
    of a managed computer network by using a pool of multiple alternative intermediate
    destinations to forward at least some communications to other final destinations.
    For example, a manager module associated with a source computing node may select
    a particular one of multiple alternative intermediate destinations to use for
    one or more particular communications from the source computing node to an indicated
    final destination, such as based on network addresses associated with the source
    computing node and/or the final destination. The multiple alternative intermediate
    destinations may have various forms, including multiple alternative edge devices
    at a first location at which various computing nodes are co-located that operate
    to manage communications between those co-located computing nodes at the first
    location and other external computer systems at one or more other locations.

  name: Singleton coordination in an actor-based system
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques for singleton coordination in an actor-based system are described
    herein. In some examples, one or more actors within an actor based system may
    be designated as singleton actors. Each singleton actor is permitted to have only
    a single associated instance in the actor-based system. In some cases, when multiple
    executing instances (i.e., duplicates) of a singleton actor are detected, the
    duplicates may be resolved, for example, such that no more than a single instance
    of the singleton actor is retained. In some examples, one or more singleton coordinators
    may be responsible for selecting one or more hubs on which to generate new or
    re-generated singletons, monitoring existing singletons to ensure that they continue
    to execute, and re-generating existing singletons after termination.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Attempts to update confirmation information or firmware for a hardware
    device can be monitored using a secure counter that is configured to monotonically
    adjust a current value of the secure counter for each update or update attempt.
    The value of the counter can be determined every time the validity of the firmware
    is confirmed, and this value can be stored to a secure location. At subsequent
    times, such as during a boot process, the actual value of the counter can be determined
    and compared with the expected value. If the values do not match, such that the
    firmware may be in an unexpected state, an action can be taken, such as to prevent
    access to, or isolate, the hardware until such time as the firmware can be validated
    or updated to an expected state.

  name: Managing committed processing rates for shared resources
  summary: ""
  abstract: Commitments against various resources can be dynamically adjusted for
    customers in a shared-resource environment. A customer can provision a data volume
    with a committed rate of Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS) and pay only
    for that commitment (plus any overage), for example, as well as the amount of
    storage requested. The customer can subsequently adjust the committed rate of
    IOPS by submitting an appropriate request, or the rate can be adjusted automatically
    based on any of a number of criteria. Data volumes for the customer can be migrated,
    split, or combined in order to provide the adjusted rate. The interaction of the
    customer with the data volume does not need to change, independent of adjustments
    in rate or changes in the data volume, other than the rate at which requests are
    processed.

  name: Return path trace
  summary: ""
  abstract: A reverse network tracing mechanism is described. In an embodiment, a
    network information request is received that is addressed to a predetermined destination.
    It is determined that the network information request has an expired timer and
    a message is returned indicating that a return network path routing procedure
    has been initiated. After determining that the network information request has
    an unexpired timer, contents of the network information request are modified to
    enable identification of at least a portion of the return path from the predetermined
    destination to a source address of the network information request.

  summary: ""
  abstract: A user attempting to obtain information about an object can capture image
    information including a view of that object, and the image information can be
    used with a matching or identification process to provide information about that
    type of object to the user. In order to narrow the search space to a specific
    category, and thus improve the accuracy of the results and the speed at which
    results can be obtained, the user can be guided to capture image information with
    an appropriate orientation. An outline or other graphical guide can be displayed
    over image information captured by a computing device, in order to guide the user
    in capturing the object from an appropriate direction and with an appropriate
    scale for the type of matching and/or information used for the matching. Such
    an approach enables three-dimensional objects to be analyzed using conventional
    two-dimensional identification algorithms, among other such processes.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Methods and apparatus that enable appliance service instances to be provisioned
    in a subnet of a customer's private network on a service provider network without
    provisioning the backend nodes in the customer's subnet. At least one front-end
    node instance is provisioned in the customer's subnet. Instead of provisioning
    the backend nodes in the customer's subnet, the appliance service provider provisions
    the backend node instances in the appliance service provider's subnet. In addition,
    at least the front-end node instance may be provided with multiple interfaces.
    At least two of the interfaces face different subnets, with one facing the customer
    subnet and the other facing the backend subnet operated by the appliance service
    provider in which the backend node instances are implemented. In some implementations,
    a third interface may face a management subnet so that the owner of the front-end
    node instance may manage the instance.

  summary: ""
  abstract: A credential management system is described that provides a way to disable
    and/or rotate credentials, such as when a credential is suspected to have been
    compromised, while minimizing potential impact to various systems that may depend
    on such credentials. The credentials may be disabled temporarily at first and
    the availability of various resources is monitored for changes. If no significant
    drop of availability in the resources has occurred, the credential may be disabled
    for a longer period of time. In this manner, the credentials may be disabled and
    re-enabled for increasingly longer time intervals until it is determined with
    sufficient confidence/certainty that disabling the credential will not adversely
    impact critical systems, at which point the credential can be rotated and/or permanently
    disabled. This process also enables the system to determine which systems are
    affected by a credential in cases where such information is not known.

  name: Optimization of categorizing data items in a computing system
  summary: ""
  abstract: A set of techniques is described for optimizing the categorization of
    data items in a computing system. The techniques include continuously metering
    data items by traversing each data item through a chain of rules in a sequential
    order until the data item matches a rule. Once the item matches the rule, it can
    be successfully categorized. The system can then analyze the number of matches
    for each rule over a period of time and optimize the sequential order of the chain
    of rules according to the analysis of the number of matches. For example, the
    system can modify the sequential order by arranging the rules according to the
    number of matches of each rule. Alternatively, the system may compute a velocity
    of matches and use it to optimize the sequential order. Alternatively, the system
    may use the rate of change to optimize the sequential order.

    not able to communicate with one of the replicas, the monitoring component can
    attempt to determine whether those replicas can communicate with each other, as
    well as whether the replicas have the same data generation version. Depending

  name: Connection following during network reconfiguration
  summary: ""
  abstract: An allocated IP address is remapped from a first virtual machine to a
    second virtual machine while maintaining existing client connections on the first
    virtual machine. A communication channel is established between the first and
    second virtual machines, and existing connections associated with the IP address
    are tracked. Packets addressed to the IP address are forwarded to the second virtual
    machine instead of the first machine. If the second virtual machine receives a
    packet that contains a new connection request, the new connection is established
    with the second virtual machine. However, if the second virtual machine receives
    a packet that is associated with an existing connection to the first virtual machine,
    then the packet is forwarded to the first virtual machine via the communication
    channel.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Watermarking techniques are described which can be performed at network
    edge locations such as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) point-of-presence (POP).
    An edge server can identify users by request and apply a watermark based on the
    user to media content stored locally. Performance is improved by moving the watermarking
    from a central location closer to the user in terms of network proximity. An edge
    server can receive instructions on what type of watermark to assign and how to
    assign it. The edge server can use requester's identity to create and apply watermarks
    at the time of transferring media content to the requester. Individualized watermarking
    is applied to the bits transmitted to the device, the watermark indicating the
    specific user downloading the stream, time of transmission, etc. Watermarking
    can be applied throughout all of the frames of the media content rather than merely
    attaching it at a specific place.

    of the instance. Metadata may also be added to a response object created as a

  summary: ""
  abstract: A service provider provides instances of computing resources for customer
    use, such as instances of data processing resources, data storage resources, database
    resources, and networking resources. A customer of the service provider might
    create a solution that utilizes one or more instances of computing resources provided
    by the service provider. The customer can request to transfer control and payment
    responsibility for computing resources, such as those utilized in a solution,
    to another customer of the distributed computing environment. In response to such
    a request, control and payment responsibility for the resources may be transferred
    to the receiving customer. The request to transfer resources might be received
    by way of a solution marketplace or through another mechanism.

  name: Efficient query processing using histograms in a columnar database
  summary: ""
  abstract: A probabilistic data structure is generated for efficient query processing
    using a histogram for unsorted data in a column of a columnar database. A bucket
    range size is determined for multiples buckets of a histogram of a column in a
    columnar database table. In at least some embodiments, the histogram may be a
    height-balanced histogram. A probabilistic data structure is generated to indicate
    for which particular buckets in the histogram there is a data value stored in
    the data block. When an indication of a query directed to the column for select
    data is received, the probabilistic data structure for each of the data blocks
    storing data for the column may be examined to determine particular ones of the
    data blocks which do not need to be read in order to service the query for the
    select data.

  abstract: An object represented in an image can be segmented from the image background
    by capturing a pair of images, one with flash and one without, and generating
    a differential image. This differential image can be analyzed using an algorithm,
    such as a connected components or computer vision algorithm, to determine one
    or more portions of the image that correspond to an object. An appropriate one
    of these objects can be selected as corresponding to the object of interest, and
    an outline of the selected object can be used to determine a portion of one of
    the original images that corresponds to the object. This portion then can be provided
    to an object recognition or other such process for analysis, which can increase
    the efficiency and accuracy of the analysis.

  name: Tracking data communicated between services
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques are described for tracking data objects transferred among multiple
    services in a computing environment. Services that are involved in the transfer
    of data objects may be instrumented to generate recordings that describe outbound
    and inbound transfers of data objects. The recordings may be analyzed to identify
    key-value pairs included in the transferred data objects, where the key corresponds
    to a data attribute that stores a particular value in a data object. For each
    pair of keys that are associated with a same or substantially similar value, a
    correlation metric may be updated for each instance of association. Over time,
    the correlation metric may indicate a higher degree of correlation for those pairs
    of keys that frequently share a same value. Pairs of keys exhibiting an above-threshold
    correlation count may be designated as related in that they are involved in the
    transfer of data objects.

  name: Deployment version management
  summary: ""
  abstract: Customers wanting to deploy software packages, or updates to those packages,
    across a group of servers or other computing resources can rely upon a component
    such as a resource manager to manage the deployment. The resource manager can
    utilize a data structure that stores deployment information by Revision number,
    and merges information for each verified deployment into a Mainline for those
    resources. Each Deployment can involve an Individual Release or a Baseline Release,
    and the importance of those Releases can be determined with respect to a current
    snapshot of the Mainline. Such an approach enables important Release and Deployment
    information to be quickly determined and obtained, which can help with configuring
    and scheduling future Deployments.

  name: Energy storage for memory protection during power event
  summary: ""
  abstract: An energy storage device included in a data center environment can supply
    energy to a set of solid state drives in the data center environment when power
    failure or another power event has occurred. In some embodiments, there can be
    a controller for each solid state drive. The controller can be configured to detect
    or determine the occurrence of the power failure or other power event and, in
    response, transmit a command to a respective solid state drive instructing the
    solid state drive to perform a graceful and atomic shutdown operation, so that
    data stored on the drive is made durable and the drive enters a quiescent state
    (e.g., sleep mode, hibernate mode, power-off mode, etc.). As such, the energy
    storage device can provide protection against power events to solid state drives
    that lack native (e.g., built-in, inherent, etc.) power protection mechanisms.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Methods and systems are provided herein that facilitate cost-effective
    and reliable data identification in an archival data storage system. In an embodiment,
    a data object stored in an archival data storage system is identified by a data
    object identifier which encodes storage location information that may be used
    to locate a data object stored in an archival data storage system that reduces
    the cost to store a global index. The data object identifier may also encode policy
    information such as access control information usable for validating subsequent
    access to the data object, payload validation information such as size and digest
    usable for verifying the integrity of the payload data, metadata validation information
    such as error-detection codes usable for validating integrity of the data object
    identifier and other information.

  abstract: A network-based services provider may reserve and provision primary resource
    instance capacity for a given service (e.g., enough compute instances, storage
    instances, or other virtual resource instances to implement the service) in one
    or more availability zones, and may designate contingency resource instance capacity
    for the service in another availability zone (without provisioning or reserving

    the service provider may provision resource instance(s) for a database engine
    head node in one availability zone and designate resource instance capacity for
    another database engine head node in another availability zone without instantiating
    the other database engine head node. While the service operates as expected using
    the primary resource instance capacity, the contingency resource capacity may
    be leased to other entities on a spot market. Leases for contingency instance
    capacity may be revoked when needed for the given service (e.g., during failover).

  name: Clustered dispersion of resource use in shared computing environments
  summary: ""
  abstract: Host machines and other devices performing synchronized operations can
    be dispersed across multiple racks in a data center to provide additional buffer
    capacity and to reduce the likelihood of congestion. The level of dispersion can
    depend on factors such as the level of oversubscription, as it can be undesirable
    in a highly connected network to push excessive host traffic into the aggregation
    fabric. As oversubscription levels increase, the amount of dispersion can be reduced
    and two or more host machines can be clustered on a given rack, or otherwise connected
    through the same edge switch. By clustering a portion of the machines, some of
    the host traffic can be redirected by the respective edge switch without entering
    the aggregation fabric. When provisioning hosts for a customer, application, or
    synchronized operation, for example, the levels of clustering and dispersion can
    be balanced to minimize the likelihood for congestion throughout the network.

    An indication may be provided to an application program that an application data
    object or a range of application data stored in system memory may be treated as
    persistent. Data backup may be enabled for the application data object or range
    of application data in the event of a system failure, copying the application
    data object or range of application data from system memory to non-volatile data
    storage. Upon recovery from a system failure, further data backup for the application
    data object or the range of application data may be disabled. In some embodiments,
    at least some of the application data object or range of application data may

  name: Adaptive responses to trickle-type denial of service attacks
  summary: ""
  abstract: Various approaches are provided that are able to mitigate the effects
    of potential trickle-type denial of service (DoS) attacks or similar occurrences.
    Connection values such as the maximum number of concurrent connections and the
    timeout values for new connections can be adjusted dynamically in response to
    changes in operational state and/or an amount of suspicious activity. The suspicious
    activity can include, for example, a low rate of packets or bytes per unit time,
    repetitive small headers, unrecognized headers, and other such information. In
    some embodiments the changes are made iteratively to minimize the effect of the
    changes on legitimate requests. After the level of suspicious activity decreases,
    the connection values can iteratively be readjusted hack to normal operational
    values, in order to minimize any remaining portion of the potential attack.

  name: Key derivation techniques
  summary: ""
  abstract: Systems and methods for authentication generate keys from secret credentials
    shared between authenticating parties and authenticators. Generation of the keys
    may involve utilizing specialized information that, as a result of being used
    to generate the keys, renders the generated keys usable for a smaller scope of
    uses than the secret credential. Further, key generation may involve multiple
    invocations of a function where each of at least a subset of the invocations of
    the function results in a key that has a smaller scope of permissible use than
    a key produced from a previous invocation of the function. Generated keys may
    be used as signing keys to sign messages. One or more actions may be taken depending
    on whether a message and/or the manner in which the message was submitted complies
    with restrictions of the a key's use.

  name: Managing memory in virtualized environments
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques are described for enabling a virtual machine to be presented
    with an amount of available guest memory, where a hypervisor or other privileged
    component manages the mapping of the resources based at least in part on the capacity
    of resources one or more hosts. This enables resources to be effectively oversubscribed
    to on host computing devices that have a limited amount of total available resources
    but which are running multiple virtual machines. For example, each virtual machine
    on the device can be presented as having access to the total amount of available
    resources that are available on the device or more in some cases. In some cases,
    resources may be mapped to a plurality of hosts that have available resources.

  name: Parameter based key derivation
  summary: ""
  abstract: Systems and methods for authentication generate keys from secret credentials
    shared between authenticating parties and authenticators. Generation of the keys
    may involve utilizing specialized information that, as a result of being used
    to generate the keys, renders the generated keys usable for a smaller scope of
    uses than the secret credential. Further, key generation may involve multiple
    invocations of a function where each of at least a subset of the invocations of
    the function results in a key that has a smaller scope of permissible use than
    a key produced from a previous invocation of the function. Generated keys may
    be used as signing keys to sign messages. One or more actions may be taken depending
    on whether a message and/or the manner in which the message was submitted complies
    with restrictions of the a key's use.

    staleness indicator for each established session, and may push updates to this
    session information to interested client processes, which may cache the information.
    A client process wishing to lock an item may determine whether it can do so dependent
    on the information in a corresponding database record and on its own cached session
    information.

  name: Social networking behavior-based identity system
  summary: ""
  abstract: Disclosed are various embodiments for a social networking behavior-based
    identity system that employs social networking data that a user has elected to
    share through an opt-in procedure. First social networking data is stored in association
    with a user identity. An assertion of the user identity is received from a client
    after the first social networking data is stored. Second social networking data
    is received in response to receiving the assertion of the user identity. An identity
    confidence level as to whether the user identity belongs to a user at the client
    is generated based at least in part on a comparison of the second social networking
    data with the first social networking data.

  abstract: When providing a user with native access to at least a portion of device
    hardware, the user can be prevented from modifying firmware and other configuration
    information by controlling the mechanisms used to update that information. In
    some embodiments, an asymmetric keying approach can be used to encrypt or sign
    the firmware. In other cases access can be controlled by enabling firmware updates
    only through a channel or port that is not exposed to the customer, or by mapping
    only those portions of the hardware that are to be accessible to the user. In
    other embodiments, the user can be prevented from modifying firmware by only provisioning
    the user on a machine after an initial mutability period wherein firmware can
    be modified, such that the user never has access to a device when firmware can
    be updated. Combinations and variations of the above also can be used.

  abstract: Customers accessing resources or services in a multi-tenant environment
    can obtain assurance that a provider of that environment will honor only requests
    associated with the customer and will reject any requests that might have been
    tampered with or otherwise falsely generated. Various endpoints or interfaces
    can be used, which can be located in the multi-tenant environment, in a customer

    unsigned requests, or otherwise increase the credentials of a signed request,
    on behalf of a customer. In some embodiments, additional metadata can be added
    that can increase the authentication level of the requests. Such an approach can
    enable a customer to provide or delegate access to the resources without exposing
    the credentials outside a secure environment.

    an unencrypted form. In turn, the provider may receive various instructions to
    perform cryptographic operations on behalf of the customer, and those instructions
    may be performed by the trusted execution environment.

  name: System and method for data replication using a single master failover protocol
  summary: ""
  abstract: A system that implements a data storage service may store data on behalf
    of storage service clients. The system may maintain data in multiple replicas
    of various partitions that are stored on respective computing nodes in the system.
    The system may employ a single master failover protocol, usable when a replica
    attempts to become the master replica for a replica group of which it is a member.
    Attempting to become the master replica may include acquiring a lock associated
    with the replica group, and gathering state information from the other replicas
    in the group. The state information may indicate whether another replica supports
    the attempt (in which case it is included in a failover quorum) or stores more
    recent data or metadata than the replica attempting to become the master (in which
    case synchronization may be required). If the failover quorum includes enough
    replicas, the replica may become the master.

  name: Reduced bandwidth data uploading in data systems
  summary: ""
  abstract: Methods and apparatus for uploading data from a sender to a receiver.
    A data deduplication technique is described that may reduce the bandwidth used
    in uploading data from the sender to the receiver. In the technique, the receiver,
    rather than the sender, maintains a fingerprint dictionary for previously uploaded
    data. When a sender has additional data to be uploaded, the sender extracts fingerprints
    for units of the data and sends the fingerprints to the receiver. The receiver
    checks its fingerprint dictionary to determine the data units to be uploaded and
    notifies the sender of the identified units, which then sends the identified units
    of data to the receiver. The technique may, for example, be applied in virtualized
    data store systems to reduce bandwidth usage in uploading data.

    the request was signed using the correct key for the sender. In some embodiments
    a client token is included with the request that statelessly encodes the key,
    enabling a recipient capable of decoding the client token to determine the key
    and compare that key to the signature of the request. The sender can store the
    secret information in a secure location, such as a browser security module, such
    that the secret information is not exposed to the browser or script executing
    on the client device.

  name: Appliance backnets in dedicated resource environment
  summary: ""
  abstract: A backnet can be created within a dedicated private network of a customer
    that enables a distinct party to access and/or control a portion of the resources
    within the private network. In one example, a backnet includes a separate virtual
    interface for an appliance or other such resource that is not visible or accessible
    to the customer owning the customer cloud, but can be accessed by another appliance
    or component in the customer cloud, or an appliance vendor external to the customer
    cloud. While the customer can control the permission for the backnet, the vendor
    can control or implement the resources within the backnet in a way that is isolated
    from the customer. Usage of the backnet can be separately monitored and billed
    to the vendor, even though the resources are part of the dedicated customer cloud.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques are described for tokenizing information to be stored in an
    untrusted environment. During tokenization, one or more strings in a file or data
    stream are replaced with a token. The token may be generated as a random number
    or a counter, such that the replaced string may not be derived based on the token.
    Token-to-string mapping data may be stored in a trusted environment, and the tokenized
    information may be stored in the untrusted environment. Users may search the tokenized
    information based on non-sensitive search terms present in a whitelist that is
    accessible from the untrusted environment, the whitelist providing a token-to-string
    mapping for the non-sensitive terms. The search results may be provided as redacted
    information, in which the non-sensitive strings have been detokenized based on
    the whitelist while the sensitive strings remain tokenized.

    the representation of the policy, as well as the representations supported by
    the evaluation engines, and can determine if the features of the policy update
    are supported by the representations of the engines. If so, the policy update
    can be translated to express the policy document in the supported representation(s),
    such that the policy can be utilized without having to update the relevant engines.

  name: Managing requests for security services
  summary: ""
  abstract: Embodiments of systems and methods are described for managing requests
    for security services to a provider of computing resources. In some implementations,
    a user can request that security services be provided to analyze or test a target
    network. For example, the user can request that security services conduct penetration
    testing of the target network in order to detect vulnerabilities with the target
    network's security infrastructure or configuration. The computing resource provider
    can dynamically provide the security services to the target network, for example,
    by instantiating one or more virtual machines that begin security testing of the
    target network in response to the user's request. In some embodiments, the provider
    of the security services may instantiate a security virtual machine instance (VMI)
    that can be connected to a customer's network using a secure connection, such
    as a virtual private network. The virtual machine instance can be physically located
    outside the customer's network while functioning as part of the customer's network.
    Thus, the security VMI can test security from either outside the network or from
    inside the network. In some embodiments, the VMI may test at multiple locations
    of the customer's network, for example, by establishing connections to multiple
    locations on the customer network.

  name: Custom resources in a resource stack
  summary: ""
  abstract: A resource stack managed by a resource stack provider is created based
    on a resource stack template that integrates a custom resource from a second provider
    into the resource stack using a notification system with the second provider.
    For example, a customer may create a template that defines a resource stack that
    comprises resources available from the resource stack provider and one or more
    custom resources provided by a second provider. When a resource stack is created,
    resources available from the resource stack provider may be provisioned. Custom
    resources may be initialized by notifying the provider of the custom resource
    of the requested integration of the custom resource with the resource stack and
    requested configuration details. The custom resource provider may respond with
    an indication of successful integration when the custom resource has been successfully
    initialized. After initializing the resources, the resource stack may be enabled
    for use.

  name: Selective communication of messages
  summary: ""
  abstract: A message originator may generate messaging data for selective communication
    by a messaging provider via an interface generated by a browser software application.
    The user may also interact with various content providers such that event data
    is generated based on the user interaction with each content provider. The messaging
    provider can then obtain the messaging data and the event data to determine a
    target set of messages to be published. Additionally, the messaging provider can
    select a set of message recipients to receive, or otherwise access, the target
    set of messages based on filtering criteria submitted by the message originator,
    content provider, service provider, and/or message recipients. Credit may be allocated
    based on activity associated with the communicated messages. The messaging provider
    may also facilitate additional interaction between the message originator and
    the message recipients including the initiation of additional communication channels.

  name: Monitoring and analysis of operating states in a computing environment
  summary: ""
  abstract: A set of techniques is described for monitoring and analyzing crashes
    and other malfunctions in a multi-tenant computing environment (e.g. cloud computing
    environment). The computing environment may host many applications that are executed
    on different computing resource combinations. The combinations may include varying
    types and versions of hardware or software resources. A monitoring service is
    deployed to gather statistical data about the failures occurring in the computing
    environment. The statistical data is then analyzed to identify abnormally high
    failure patterns. The failure patterns may be associated with particular computing
    resource combinations being used to execute particular types of applications.
    Based on these failure patterns, suggestions can be issued to a user to execute
    the application using a different computing resource combination. Alternatively,
    the failure patterns may be used to modify or update the various resources in
    order to correct the potential malfunctions caused by the resource.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Disclosed are various embodiments for automated service interface optimization.
    In one embodiment, a service client and/or a service provider is reconfigured
    to use an optimized version of a data transfer interface, where the optimized
    version transfers fewer data items from the service provider to the service client.
    In another embodiment, service calls from a service client for multiple different
    data objects are aggregated into an aggregated service call for a data object.
    In yet another embodiment, an optimized data object is provided to a service client
    in response to a request for an unoptimized data object. If the service client
    attempts to use a data item excluded from the optimized data object, the excluded
    data item is then provided to the service client.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Session-specific information stored to a cookie or other secure token
    can be selected and/or caused to vary over time, such that older copies will become
    less useful over time. Such an approach reduces the ability of entities obtaining
    a copy of the cookie from performing unauthorized tasks on a session. A cookie
    received with a request can contain a timestamp and an operation count for a session
    that may need to fall within an acceptable range of the current values in order
    for the request to be processed. A cookie returned with a response can be set
    to the correct value or incremented from the previous value based on various factors.
    The allowable bands can decrease with age of the session, and various parameter
    values such as a badness factor for a session can be updated continually based
    on the events for the session.

  abstract: Users intending to launch instances or otherwise access virtual resources

    The use of an appropriate launch configuration can be enforced for any type of
    user at any level, such as at the sub-net level, by modifying a request that does

  abstract: Methods and apparatus for instance host configuration are disclosed. A
    system includes a plurality of instance hosts configurable for resource instances
    of a network-accessible service, and control servers to manage remote configuration
    of the instance hosts. In response to an instance configuration request from a
    client, a selected control server transmits, to a selected instance host, a sequence
    of one or more commands. The selected instance host instantiates a remote command
    executor. The remote command executor initiates configuration operations corresponding

  summary: ""
  abstract: A physical computer system includes a processor and a memory configured
    to store instructions executable by the processor to implement a virtualization
    module, which in turn implements virtual machine(s) that execute an operating
    system distinct from any underlying operating system executed by the physical
    computer system. In response to a client request to initially perform a repeatable
    computation, the virtualization module instructs that the virtual machine(s) archive
    an original initial state of the repeatable computation, initially perform the
    repeatable computation, and archive an original terminal state of the repeatable
    computation. In response to a client request to repeat the repeatable computation,
    the virtualization module instructs that the virtual machine(s) be initialized
    according to configuration information indicated by the archived original initial
    state of the repeatable computation, and that the one or more virtual machines
    perform the repeatable computation to generate a new terminal state of the repeatable
    computation.

  name: Concurrency control in database transactions
  summary: ""
  abstract: To achieve long running batch updates, a transaction aggregator layer
    and one or more data aggregation queues, such as a command queue, are placed between
    one or more clients and a database. Writes go to the database aggregator layer
    and are enqueued in the appropriate data aggregation queue, which may be allocated
    by transaction. Committing the transaction drains the queue and writes the contents
    of the queue in one transaction-like update to the database. By using the transaction
    logic in the transaction aggregator layer, transaction-like behavior may be achieved
    that allows both updates and transactions to scale with less impact on database
    servers.

    mechanism may manage requests based on tokens, each of which represents a fixed
    amount of work. The tokens may be added to a token bucket at rate that is dependent
    on a target work throughput rate while the number of tokens in the bucket does
    not exceed its maximum capacity. If at least a pre-determined minimum number of
    tokens is present in the bucket when a service request is received, it may be
    serviced. Servicing a request may include deducting an initial number of tokens
    from the bucket, determining that the amount of work performed in servicing the
    request is different than that represented by the initially deducted tokens, and
    deducting additional tokens from or replacing tokens in the bucket to reflect
    the difference.

  name: User transportable device with hazard monitoring
  summary: ""
  abstract: In some examples, a user transportable device may determine, based at
    least in part on sensor input, that the device is in motion. For example, the
    device may determine there is a likelihood that a user of the device is walking,
    running, traveling in a vehicle, or the like. In response, the device may present,
    on a display, an image obtained from a camera oriented, at least in part, toward
    a direction of travel. Further, in some examples, one or more images from the
    camera and/or sensor input from other sensors on the device may be analyzed to
    detect whether an object, obstruction or other hazard is in a direction of travel
    of the user of the device. If the device determines that a hazard may be imminently
    encountered by the user, the device may provide an alert to the user.

  name: Determining computing-related resources to use based on client-specified constraints
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques for facilitating a client's control over use of computing-related
    resources on the client's behalf. In some situations, a client's control is based
    on specifying a group of one or more resource usage constraints with a client
    resource constraint manager service, which provides information about the client-specified
    constraints to one or more other remote network services with which the client
    interacts. Those remote services then use that constraint information to determine
    whether and how to use computing-related resources on the client's behalf. For
    example, the resource usage constraints specified by a client may relate to one
    or more particular geographical areas and/or to one or more measures of relative
    proximity between computing-related resources (e.g., between multiple instances
    of a single type of computing-related resource provided by a single service, or
    between multiple distinct types of computing-related resources provided by multiple
    unaffiliated services).

  name: Managing communications for modified computer networks
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques are described for managing communications between multiple
    computing nodes, such as computing nodes that are part of a virtual computer network.
    In some situations, various types of modifications may be made to one or more
    computing nodes of an existing virtual computer network, and the described techniques
    include managing ongoing communications for those computing nodes so as to accommodate
    the modifications. Such modifications may include, for example, migrating or otherwise
    moving a particular computing node that is part of a virtual network to a new
    physical network location, or modifying other aspects of how the computing node
    participates in the virtual network (e.g., changing one or more virtual network
    addresses used by the computing node). In some situations, the computing nodes
    may include virtual machine nodes hosted on one or more physical computing machines
    or systems, such as by or on behalf of one or more users.

  name: Managing I/O operations in a virtualized environment
  summary: ""
  abstract: A set of techniques is described for performing input/output (I/O) between
    a guest domain and a host domain in a virtualized environment. A pool of memory
    buffers is reserved for performing virtualized I/O operations. The reserved pool
    of memory buffers has static mappings that grant access to both the guest domain
    and the host domain. When a request to perform an I/O operation is received, the
    system can determine whether the memory buffers allocated to the I/O operation
    belong to the reserved pool. If the buffers are in the reserved pool, the host
    domain executes the I/O operation using the buffers without the need to map/unmap
    the buffers and perform TLB flushes. If the buffers are not in the reserved pool,
    the system can either copy the data into the reserved pool or perform the mapping
    and unmapping of the memory buffers to the address space of the host domain.

  name: Dynamic data loss prevention in a multi-tenant environment
  summary: ""
  abstract: The usage of data in a multi-tenant environment can be controlled by utilizing
    functionality at the hypervisor level of various resources in the environment.
    Data can be associated with various tags, security levels, and/or compartments.
    The ability of resources or entities to access the data can depend at least in
    part upon whether the resources or entities are also associated with the tags,
    security levels, and/or compartments. Limitations on the usage of the data can
    be controlled by one or more policies associated with the tags, security levels,
    and/or compartments. A control service can monitor traffic to enforce the appropriate
    rules or policies, and in some cases can prevent encrypted traffic from passing
    beyond a specified egress point unless the encryption was performed by a trusted
    resource with the appropriate permissions.

  name: Object loss reporting in a data storage system
  summary: ""
  abstract: In response to receiving a request from a client to store an object, a
    key-durable storage system may assign the object to a volume in its data store,
    generate a key for the object (e.g., an opaque identifier that encodes information
    for locating the object in the data store), store the object on one disk in the
    assigned volume, store the key redundantly in the assigned volume (e.g., using
    a replication or erasure coding technique), and may return the key to the client.
    To retrieve the object, the client may send a request including the key, and the
    system may return the object to the client. If a disk fails, the system may determine
    which objects were lost, and may return the corresponding keys to the appropriate
    clients in a notification. The system may be used to back up a more expensive
    object-redundant storage system.

  name: Saving program execution state
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques are described for managing distributed execution of programs.
    In at least some situations, the techniques include decomposing or otherwise separating
    the execution of a program into multiple distinct execution jobs that may each
    be executed on a distinct computing node, such as in a parallel manner with each
    execution job using a distinct subset of input data for the program. In addition,
    the techniques may include temporarily terminating and later resuming execution
    of at least some execution jobs, such as by persistently storing an intermediate
    state of the partial execution of an execution job, and later retrieving and using
    the stored intermediate state to resume execution of the execution job from the
    intermediate state. Furthermore, the techniques may be used in conjunction with
    a distributed program execution service that executes multiple programs on behalf
    of multiple customers or other users of the service.

  name: Dynamic image selection
  summary: ""
  abstract: Image capture can be improved by capturing a sequence of images and analyzing
    the images to select the image with the least blur and/or an acceptable amount
    of blur. Gradients can be calculated for at least a portion of the images, and
    gradient histograms generated. Two or more component curves can be fit to each
    histogram, such as by using a Gaussian mixture model, and the curves can be compared
    to determine an amount of variation between the curves. The image with the smallest
    differences between component curves, or with differences less than a specified
    blur threshold, can be selected as a sufficiently sharp image and provided for
    viewing, processing, or another intended purpose of the image to be captured.

  abstract: Methods and apparatus for providing scalable private services in service
    provider networking environments. A service provider that provides a large, public,
    multi-tenant implementation of a web service to multiple customers via a public
    API endpoint may allow a customer to request the establishment of a private implementation
    of the service. In response, a service private instance may be automatically and/or
    manually established for the customer that provides a private API endpoint to
    the service and that is at least in part implemented on single-tenant hardware
    that is not shared with other customers. The service private instance may initially
    be implemented as a relatively small scale and possibly limited implementation
    of the service when compared to the service public instance. As the needs of the
    customer grow, the service private instance may be automatically and/or manually
    scaled up from the initial implementation.

    rate. If the target or committed work throughput rate is being exceeded, but the
    maximum request rate is not being exceeded, a lower maximum request rate may be

  name: Virtual firewalls for multi-tenant distributed services
  summary: ""
  abstract: Virtual firewalls may be established that enforce sets of policies with
    respect to computing resources maintained by multi-tenant distributed services.
    Particular subsets of computing resources may be associated with particular tenants
    of a multi-tenant distributed service. A tenant may establish a firewalling policy
    set enforced by a virtual firewall for an associated subset of computing resources
    without affecting other tenants of the multi-tenant distributed service. Virtual
    firewalls enforcing multiple firewalling policy sets may be maintained by a common
    firewalling component of the multi-tenant distributed service. Firewalling policy
    sets may be distributed at multiple locations throughout the multi-tenant distributed
    service. For a request targeting a particular computing resource, the common firewalling
    component may identify the associated virtual firewall, and submit the request
    to the virtual firewall for evaluation in accordance with the corresponding firewalling
    policy set.

  name: Mining of user event data to identify users with common interests
  summary: ""
  abstract: A computer-implemented matching service matches users to other users,
    and/or to user communities, based at least in part on a computer analysis of event
    data reflective of user behaviors. The event data may, for example, evidence user
    affinities for particular items represented in an electronic catalog, such as
    book titles, music titles, movie titles, and/or other types of items that tend
    to reflect the traits of users. Event data reflective of other types of user actions,
    such as item-detail-page viewing events, browse node visits, search query submissions,
    and/or web browsing patterns may additionally or alternatively be considered.
    By taking such event data into consideration, the matching service reduces the
    burden on users to explicitly supply personal profile information, and reduces
    poor results caused by exaggerations and other inaccuracies in such profile information.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Systems and methods for authentication generate keys from secret credentials
    shared between authenticating parties and authenticators. Generation of the keys
    may involve utilizing specialized information in the form of parameters that are
    used to specialize keys. Keys and/or information derived from keys held by multiple

    such keys and/or information can be verified without access to the keys. Keys
    may also be derived to form a hierarchy of keys that are distributed such that
    a key holder's ability to decrypt data depends on the key's position in the hierarchy
    relative to the position of a key used to encrypt the data. Key hierarchies may
    also be used to distribute key sets to content processing devices to enable the
    devices to decrypt content such that sources or potential sources of unauthorized
    content are identifiable from the decrypted content.

  abstract: When providing a user with native access to at least a portion of device
    hardware, the user can be prevented from modifying firmware and other configuration
    information by controlling the mechanisms used to update that information. In
    some embodiments, an asymmetric keying approach can be used to encrypt or sign

    only through a channel or port that is not exposed to the customer, or by mapping
    only those portions of the hardware that are to be accessible to the user. In
    other embodiments, the user can be prevented from modifying firmware by only provisioning
    the user on a machine after an initial mutability period wherein firmware can
    be modified, such that the user never has access to a device when firmware can
    be updated. Combinations and variations of the above also can be used.

  name: Parameter normalization for improved cache hit rate
  summary: ""
  abstract: A normalized caching system may receive a data request from a requestor,
    the request associated with a requested service. The normalized caching system
    may generate a normalized request by modifying one or more parameters of the request.
    A normalized response is typically useful for servicing a wider range of subsequent
    requests than is a non-normalized response. The system may then check whether
    an entry is cached for the normalized request. If no cached entry is found, the
    normalized request may be submitted to the requested service, and response received
    in return. The normalized response may be cached using the normalized request.
    The response may be denormalized in order to generate a response which is provided
    to the requestor. When a subsequent request is received, if that subsequent request
    normalizes to the same normalized request, it may be fulfilled using the response
    stored in cache, rather than using the requested service.

  name: Post attack man-in-the-middle detection
  summary: ""
  abstract: Technologies are described herein for post attack man-in-the-middle detection.
    A first computer receives and stores public key certificates when connections
    are established. The first computer also uploads the stored public key certificates
    associated with a domain to a second computer each time a connection is established
    with the domain. The second computer receives the public key certificates from
    the first computer. The second computer then determines whether any of the public
    key certificates provided by the first computer are fraudulent certificates by
    comparing the received certificates to known valid certificates. If the second
    computer determines that the first computer has received one or more fraudulent
    certificates, the second computer may cause action to be taken with regard to
    the fraudulent certificates.

  name: Streaming and sampling in real-time log analysis
  summary: ""
  abstract: Technologies are described herein for incorporating streaming and/or sampling
    in real-time log analysis. Representative samples of log data are extracted from
    the log files on a number of monitored hosts and streamed in real-time to log
    processors for processing. The log processors accumulate and process the representative
    samples of log data, and track a data completeness value representing an indication
    of a proportion of total log data represented by the representative samples received.
    The representative samples of log data are merged and collated. Estimated metrics
    are calculated from the merged and collated representative samples and the data
    completeness, and the estimated metrics are published to consumers in near real-time.

  name: System and method for maintaining a master replica for reads and writes in
    a data store
  summary: ""
  abstract: A system that implements a data storage service may store data on behalf
    of clients in multiple replicas on respective computing nodes. The system may
    employ an external service to select a master replica for a replica group. The
    master replica may service consistent read operations and/or write operations
    that are directed to the replica group (or to a data partition stored by the replica
    group). The master replica may employ a quorum based mechanism for performing
    replicated write operations, and a local lease mechanism for determining the replica
    authorized to perform consistent reads, even when the external service is unavailable.
    The master replica may propagate local leases to replica group members as replicated
    writes. If another replica assumes mastership for the replica group, it may not
    begin servicing consistent read operations that are directed to the replica group
    until the lease period for a current local lease expires.

  name: Managing API authorization
  summary: ""
  abstract: Multiple variants of an API can coexist through API management by using
    metadata in a pre-processing and post-processing system to weed out requests to
    which a client does not have permission and return parameters that do not belong
    with the API request variant. Metadata is added to request objects such that an
    instance of a request object may be examined to determine a request handler to
    properly inspect the request object and recommend further processing or rejection
    of the instance. Metadata may also be added to a response object created as a
    result of processing the request object such that a response handler may be identified
    to ensure the fields match the proper response to the request object. The API
    may be dynamically managed at the point of request and also at the point of return
    rather than a statically coded whitelist checked multiple times within the code
    itself.

  abstract: Shared resources can be isolated such that abuse of the resource by one
    user does not significantly affect the use of that resource by another user. A
    combination of access and flow control can be used, wherein a control gateway
    or other such component sits along a path between the user and the resource, such
    that the user obtains connections or access to the resource through the gateway.
    In this way, the gateway can control aspects such as the number of concurrent
    threads or channels granted to a user, as well as any delay in providing these
    threads or channels to the resource. A closed feedback loop can provide real-time
    information such that adjustments can be made dynamically, preventing abuse by
    users while also preventing the resource allocations from being underutilized.

  name: System and method for performing replica copying using a physical copy mechanism
  summary: ""
  abstract: A system that implements a data storage service may maintain tables in
    a data store on behalf of clients. The service may maintain table data in multiple
    replicas of partitions of the data that are stored on respective computing nodes
    in the system. In response to detecting a failure or fault condition, or receiving
    a service request from a client to move or copy a partition replica, the data
    store may copy a partition replica to another computing node using a physical
    copy mechanism. The physical copy mechanism may copy table data from physical
    storage locations in which it is stored to physical storage locations allocated
    to a destination replica on the other computing node. During copying, service
    requests to modify table data may be logged and applied to the replica being copied.
    A catch-up operation may be performed to apply modification requests received
    during copying to the destination replica.

  abstract: Techniques are described for managing access of executing programs to
    non-local block data storage. In some situations, a block data storage service
    uses multiple server storage systems to reliably store copies of network-accessible
    block data storage volumes that may be used by programs executing on other physical
    computing systems, and snapshot copies of some volumes may also be stored (e.g.,
    on remote archival storage systems). A group of multiple server block data storage
    systems that store block data volumes may in some situations be co-located at
    a data center, and programs that use volumes stored there may execute on other
    computing systems at that data center, while the archival storage systems may
    be located outside the data center. The snapshot copies of volumes may be used
    in various ways, including to allow users to obtain their own copies of other
    users' volumes (e.g., for a fee).

  abstract: Some embodiments facilitate high performance packet-processing by enabling

    packet that entered the first stage of the pipeline and compare that with a packet
    that the processor just processed in a pipeline stage to determine whether there
    may be more packets coming that need processing. In some embodiments, a processor
    may also look at a queue length of a queue associated with an upstream stage to
    determine whether more packets may be coming.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Disclosed are various embodiments for performing cross-domain communication
    using messenger frames. One or more messenger frames are dynamically generated
    in response to determining that a message is to be sent from a first frame in
    one domain to a second frame in another domain in a client. The message is sent
    from the first frame to the second frame by embedding the message in addresses
    of the messenger frames. Code executing in the first frame and code executing
    in the second frame are restricted from direct communication in the client.

  name: Attributing causality to program execution capacity modifications
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques are described for managing program execution capacity, such
    as for a group of computing nodes that are provided for executing one or more
    programs for a user. In some situations, dynamic program execution capacity modifications
    for a computing node group that is in use may be performed periodically or otherwise
    in a recurrent manner, such as to aggregate multiple modifications that are requested
    or otherwise determined to be made during a period of time. In addition, various
    operations may be performed to attribute causality information or other responsibility
    for particular program execution capacity modifications that are performed, including
    by attributing a single event as causing one capacity modification, and a combination
    of multiple events as possible causes for another capacity modification. The techniques
    may in some situations be used in conjunction with a fee-based program execution
    service that executes multiple programs on behalf of multiple users of the service.

  name: User-guided object identification
  summary: ""
  abstract: A user attempting to obtain information about an object can capture image
    information including a view of that object, and the image information can be
    used with a matching or identification process to provide information about that
    type of object to the user. In order to narrow the search space to a specific
    category, and thus improve the accuracy of the results and the speed at which
    results can be obtained, the user can be guided to capture image information with
    an appropriate orientation. An outline or other graphical guide can be displayed
    over image information captured by a computing device, in order to guide the user
    in capturing the object from an appropriate direction and with an appropriate
    scale for the type of matching and/or information used for the matching. Such
    an approach enables three-dimensional objects to be analyzed using conventional
    two-dimensional identification algorithms, among other such processes.

  abstract: This disclosure describes various processes for collecting information
    about users from sources other than catalog activity data. This information can
    be used to generate recommendations for users with activity data deficiencies.
    Some example sources for this supplemental data include collaborative content
    sites, such as social networking sites. Social networking sites typically allow
    users to engage in conversations with other users through text, audio, and/or
    video. Conversation data collected from these sites or from other sources can
    be analyzed to infer user interests. A recommendation process (or other application)
    can use the inferred interests to supplement or take the place of catalog activity
    data.

  name: Dynamic traffic management
  summary: ""
  abstract: Requests from multiple users for one or more shared resources can be dynamically
    throttled based on at least one allowance value determined for each user at a
    current point in time. One or more business functions or other such algorithms
    can be used to determine an appropriate allowance value for a user based on any
    of a number of appropriate factors, such as the cost of a resource, a value of
    the user, a request volume of the user, or other such factors. The values for
    each user can be fed into one or more algorithms to determine information such
    as request limits, burst limits, and costs per request. Such approaches provide
    for dynamic and fine-grained traffic shaping while allowing for variance of these
    limits or values over time.

  name: Monitoring services and service consumers
  summary: ""
  abstract: A monitoring service may receive, from a plurality of service providers,
    log information pertaining to access calls made by service consumers to services
    or APIs provided by the service providers. The monitoring service aggregates and
    analyzes the log information for use in monitoring performance of the services,
    identifying anomalies, and the like. In some instances, the monitoring service
    may identify multiple services that are behaviorally interrelated based on at
    least one performance metric, and may group these services together into service
    groups for monitoring purposes. A service relationship model may be generated
    for each of the service groups that predicts how each service will behave relative
    to the other services in the service group. The monitoring service may monitor
    performance and use of the services based, at least in part, on the one or more
    service groups and the service relationship model for each group.

  name: Dynamic conversion and use of non-monetary rewards
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques are described for using loyalty program points and other non-monetary
    loyalty rewards from a first organization in a monetary manner at a distinct second
    organization, such as to acquire an item from a merchant at a cost that is reduced
    by a monetary amount based on the loyalty reward used. In some situations, the
    first organization programmatically interacts with a merchant to cause a gift
    certificate to be dynamically created for the merchant in an appropriate monetary
    amount, and later applies the gift certificate to reduce the cost of the item
    acquisition. In addition, in some situations such acquiring of items by a user
    from a merchant is performed based on interactions between the user and the merchant
    that are performed so as to appear to the user to be with the first organization
    and such that subsequent interactions continue between the user and the first
    organization.

    of a managed computer network by automatically determining to separate a particular
    outgoing packet or other outgoing communication from a source computing node into
    multiple parts (e.g., multiple packets) to be independently sent using two or
    more alternative network paths between the sending computing node and the destination
    for the communication. For example, a manager module associated with the source
    computing node may automatically determine to encode the outgoing communication
    into a dynamically determined quantity of multiple parts (e.g., by using a configurable
    erasure code), such as based on current information about available alternative
    paths, and another manager module associated with the destination may receive
    at least some of the multiple parts and decode them into the original outgoing
    communication, which is then provided to the destination.

  name: Resource resolution in computing environments using directed graphs
  summary: ""
  abstract: Methods and apparatus for resource resolution in computing environments
    using directed graphs are disclosed. A system includes a resource resolver and
    data sources that comprise records on resource classes of a provider network.
    The resolver receives a request to identify a set of resources of the provider
    network based on specified criteria. The resolver utilizes a directed graph representation
    of the data sources to identify query sequences to be directed to the data sources
    in response to the request. Each node of the graph represents a data source, and
    each edge represents a logical relationship between the data sources represented
    by the nodes connected by the edge. Each edge has a weight based on a performance
    metric obtained from a data source whose node is connected by the edge. The resolver
    issues queries of a preferred query sequence, identified using edge weights, to
    respective data sources.

  name: System and method for implementing a scalable data storage service
  summary: ""
  abstract: A system that implements a scalable data storage service may maintain
    tables in a non-relational data store on behalf of clients. The system may provide
    a Web services interface through which service requests are received, and an API
    usable to request that a table be created, deleted, or described; that an item
    be stored, retrieved, deleted, or its attributes modified; or that a table be
    queried (or scanned) with filtered items and/or their attributes returned. An
    asynchronous workflow may be invoked to create or delete a table. Items stored
    in tables may be partitioned and indexed using a simple or composite primary key.
    The system may not impose pre-defined limits on table size, and may employ a flexible
    schema. The service may provide a best-effort or committed throughput model. The
    system may automatically scale and/or re-partition tables in response to detecting
    workload changes, node failures, or other conditions or anomalies.

    nodes of a computer network. In some situations, multiple computing nodes of a
    provided computer network may share a single virtual network address, and communications
    sent to that single virtual network address by other computing nodes may be managed
    in various manners. For example, the multiple computing nodes sharing the single
    virtual network address may be part of a pool of alternative destinations associated
    with the single virtual network address, and particular computing nodes from the
    pool may be selected to receive particular communications sent to the single virtual
    network address. Pools of multiple related computing nodes may also be identified
    and monitored in various manners. In some situations, the computing nodes may
    include virtual machine nodes hosted on one or more physical computing machines

  name: Failover and recovery for replicated data instances
  summary: ""
  abstract: Replicated instances in a database environment provide for automatic failover
    and recovery. A monitoring component can periodically communicate with a primary
    and a secondary replica for an instance, with each capable of residing in a separate
    data zone or geographic location to provide a level of reliability and availability.
    A database running on the primary instance can have information synchronously
    replicated to the secondary replica at a block level, such that the primary and
    secondary replicas are in sync. In the event that the monitoring component is
    not able to communicate with one of the replicas, the monitoring component can
    attempt to determine whether those replicas can communicate with each other, as
    well as whether the replicas have the same data generation version. Depending
    on the state information, the monitoring component can automatically perform a
    recovery operation, such as to failover to the secondary replica or perform secondary
    replica recovery.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Users intending to launch instances or otherwise access virtual resources
    in a multi-tenant environment can specify a launch configuration. For each type
    of instance or each type of user, at least one launch configuration is created
    that includes parameters and values to be used in instantiating an instance of
    that type, the values being optimized for the current environment and type of
    instance. Launch configurations can be optimized for different types of users,
    such as to account for security credentials and access levels. Such an approach
    enables users to launch instances by contacting the resource provider directly
    without need for a proxy, which can function as a choke point under heavy load.
    The use of an appropriate launch configuration can be enforced for any type of
    user at any level, such as at the sub-net level, by modifying a request that does
    not specify an appropriate launch configuration.

    affinities for particular items represented in an electronic catalog, such as
    book titles, music titles, movie titles, and/or other types of items that tend
    to reflect the traits of users. Event data reflective of other types of user actions,

    and/or web browsing patterns may additionally or alternatively be considered.
    By taking such event data into consideration, the matching service reduces the

  name: Virtual resource provisioning by assigning colors to virtual resources in
    multi-tenant resource pool
  summary: ""
  abstract: Virtual resource provisioning may be enhanced by coloring virtual resource
    instances and/or underlying implementation resources. Particular resource colors
    may be associated with particular treatments during allocation of implementation
    resources to virtual resources. There may be different types of colors corresponding
    to different types of allocation treatment. Exclusory colors may be utilized to
    reduce clustering of virtual resources with respect to implementation resources.
    Assignment of exclusory colors to virtual resources can help strike a balance
    between lower costs through efficient implementation resource utilization and
    higher fault tolerance through spreading across an available implementation resource
    pool. Inclusive colors may be utilized to require and/or prefer allocation of
    virtual resources to implementation resources painted with the inclusive color.
    Proximity colors may be utilized to enhance a computational performance of a set
    of virtual resources. Proximity colors may be associated with proximity specifications
    that define proximity in implementation resource networks.

    location based on a location of a mobile device. A transaction between the user
    and a merchant may be completed with zero or minimal input from the user based
    on the geolocation of the mobile device and the user identifiers. In some implementations,
    a transaction initiated earlier is completed when the mobile device arrives at
    the merchant. Additionally, a parent-child or similar relationship may be established
    between multiple devices. Security on the mobile device based may be provided
    by biometric identification and calculation of variance from regular movement
    patterns. Advertisements may be sent to the mobile device based on bids from merchants
    near to the mobile device. Promotions may be sent to the mobile device when more
    than a threshold number of mobile devices are located at the same merchant.

  abstract: A system and method for performing financial reconciliation of two systems
    using checksums generally consists of a primary and a secondary system connected
    via a communications network, wherein each system includes a data source and is
    adapted to independently calculate one or more checksums pertaining to the data
    according to the same formula and at the same time. Information, such as data
    pertaining to financial transactions, may be stored in the primary data source
    and replicated to the secondary data source via asynchronous messages. The data
    in the primary and secondary data sources may be reconciled at regular intervals
    by comparing the checksum calculated by the primary system with the checksum calculated
    by the secondary system at a given time. If the checksums match, the data is considered
    to be reconciled. If the checksums do not match, then a recovery process may be
    initiated to ensure that the data in the primary system is completely and accurately
    transferred to the secondary system.

  name: Dynamic resource commitment management
  summary: ""
  abstract: Various aspects of a data volume or other shared resource are determined
    and updated dynamically for purposes such as to provide guaranteed qualities of
    service. For example, the number of partitions in a data volume and/or the way
    in which data is stored across those partitions can be updated dynamically without
    significantly impacting the customer using the volume. The data stored to the
    volume can be striped or otherwise distributed across a number of logical areas,
    which then can be distributed across the partitions. Separate mappings can be
    used for the data in each logical area, and the logical areas in each partition,
    such that when moving a logical area only a single mapping has to be updated,
    regardless of the amount of data in that logical area. Further, logical areas
    can be moved between partitions without the need to repartition or redistributed
    the data in the data volume.

  name: Balancing latency and throughput for shared resources
  summary: ""
  abstract: Input and output (I/O) operations performed by a data storage device are
    managed dynamically to balance aspects such as throughput and latency. Sequential
    read and write requests are sent to a data storage device whereby the corresponding
    operations are performed without time delay due to extra disk revolutions. In
    order to minimize latency, particularly for read operations, random read and write
    requests are held in a queue upstream of an I/O controller of the data storage
    device until the buffer of the data storage device is empty. The queued requests
    can be reordered when a higher priority request is received, improving the overall
    latency for specific requests. An I/O scheduler of a data server is still able
    to use any appropriate algorithm to order I/O requests, such as by prioritizing
    reads over writes as long as the writes do not back up in the I/O queue beyond
    a certain threshold.

  summary: ""
  abstract: A computer system that provides services to clients may adaptively throttle
    incoming service requests in order to reach and then maintain operation at an
    ideal request rate. An ideal request rate may be a maximum rate at which incoming
    service requests can be serviced such that client-specified quality of service
    (QoS) expectations are met for most or all incoming service requests, or a rate
    within a range of rates defined by that maximum rate. Determining whether the
    system is operating at an ideal request rate may include determining the minimum
    difference between the expected and actual QoS for a group of recently serviced
    requests. The system may gradually modify a throttle multiplier value in order
    to reach or maintain an ideal request rate. Maintaining operation at an ideal
    request rate may allow the system to avoid entering an overloaded state, and/or
    oscillating between an overloaded state and a non-overloaded state.

    For example, the computing node selection for a particular program may be performed
    so as to attempt to identify and use computing nodes that already locally store
    some or all of the input data that will be used by those computing nodes as part
    of the executing of that program on those nodes. Such techniques may provide benefits
    in a variety of situations, including when the size of input datasets to be used
    by a program are large, and the transferring of data to and/or from computing
    nodes may impose large delays and/or monetary costs.

    partition changes. For example, if a replica of a partition is promoted to be
    a primary copy due to hardware or network failures, partition map changes may
    only be propagated to nodes in the same replica group. For major partition changes
    (e.g., splits, moves, mergers, added partitions, or size change), a new partition
    map may be made available to all nodes.

  name: System and method for determining overload state for service requests
  summary: ""
  abstract: A computer system that provides services to clients may be configured
    to determine whether it is operating in an overloaded state based on the percentage
    of client-specified quality of service (QoS) expectations that are not met. For
    example, if the percentage of service requests in a group of recently serviced
    requests for which client-specified expectations of a maximum response time were
    not met is greater than a pre-determined overload threshold, the system may be
    considered to be in an overloaded state. The overload threshold may be configurable.
    The overload state may be determined periodically by determining the percentage
    of service requests in a moving window of time for which client-specified QoS
    expectations were not met. In response to determining that the system is operating
    in an overloaded state, it may be configured to throttle at least a portion of
    incoming service requests in an attempt to exit the overloaded state.

  name: Clustered device dispersion in a multi-tenant environment
  summary: ""
  abstract: Host machines and other devices performing synchronized operations can
    be dispersed across multiple racks in a data center to provide additional buffer
    capacity and to reduce the likelihood of congestion. The level of dispersion can
    depend on factors such as the level of oversubscription, as it can be undesirable
    in a highly connected network to push excessive host traffic into the aggregation
    fabric. As oversubscription levels increase, the amount of dispersion can be reduced
    and two or more host machines can be clustered on a given rack, or otherwise connected
    through the same edge switch. By clustering a portion of the machines, some of
    the host traffic can be redirected by the respective edge switch without entering
    the aggregation fabric. When provisioning hosts for a customer, application, or
    synchronized operation, for example, the levels of clustering and dispersion can
    be balanced to minimize the likelihood for congestion throughout the network.

  summary: ""
  abstract: A computer system that provides services to clients may be configured
    to adaptively throttle incoming service requests. It may modify throttle parameters
    to aggressively increase throttling in response to detecting that the system is
    in an overloaded state. For example, a throttle multiplier value may be increased
    by a large amount in an attempt to quickly exit the overloaded state. The throttle
    multiplier value may be increased multiple times before the system exits the overloaded
    state. The percentage of incoming requests that are throttled and/or the particular
    requests that are throttled may be dependent on the throttle multiplier value
    and/or on a request priority rank. Some time after the system returns to a non-overloaded
    state, the system may gradually reduce throttling by iteratively decreasing the
    throttle multiplier value until it is zero. Gradually reducing throttling may
    allow the system to avoid oscillating between an overloaded state and a non-overloaded

  name: Saving program execution state
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques are described for managing distributed execution of programs.
    In at least some situations, the techniques include decomposing or otherwise separating
    the execution of a program into multiple distinct execution jobs that may each
    be executed on a distinct computing node, such as in a parallel manner with each
    execution job using a distinct subset of input data for the program. In addition,
    the techniques may include temporarily terminating and later resuming execution
    of at least some execution jobs, such as by persistently storing an intermediate
    state of the partial execution of an execution job, and later retrieving and using
    the stored intermediate state to resume execution of the execution job from the
    intermediate state. Furthermore, the techniques may be used in conjunction with
    a distributed program execution service that executes multiple programs on behalf
    of multiple customers or other users of the service.

  name: Distributed encryption key management
  summary: ""
  abstract: Secure information is managed for each host or machine in an electronic
    environment using a series of key identifiers that each represent one or more
    secure keys, passwords, or other secure information. Applications and services
    needing access to the secure information can specify the key identifier, for example,
    and the secure information currently associated with that identifier can be determined
    without any change to the code or manual input or exposure of the secure information
    on the respective device. Functionality such as encryption key management and
    rotation are inaccessible and transparent to the user. In a networked or distributed
    environment, the key identifiers can be associated with host classes such that
    at startup any host in a class can obtain the necessary secure information. Updates
    and key rotation can be performed in a similar fashion by pushing updates to host
    classes transparent to a user, application, or service.

  name: Locating product references in content pages
  summary: ""
  abstract: Disclosed are various embodiments for locating product references in community
    content. Character sequences (n-grams) are extracted from a page of text content.
    Each n-gram is evaluated as a potential product reference using a product catalog
    search for the n-gram or a conditional probability for the n-gram. The conditional
    probability is obtained from behavior-based search data. When the search was used
    for the evaluation, each n-gram is found to be a potential product based on results
    from the product catalog search. When the behavior-based search data was used
    for the evaluation; each n-gram is found to be a potential product based on the
    conditional probability exceeding a threshold.

  name: Management of object mapping information corresponding to a distributed storage
    system
  summary: ""
  abstract: Systems and methods for managing mapping information for objects maintained
    in a distributed storage system are provided. The distributed storage system can
    include a keymap subsystem that manages the mapping information according to object
    keys. Requests for specific object mapping information are directed to specific
    keymap coordinators within the keymap subsystem. Each keymap coordinator can maintain
    a cache for caching mapping information maintained at various information sources.
    To manage the cache, the keymap system can utilize information placeholders that
    replace previously cached keymap information while a request to modify keymap
    information is being processed by the information sources. Each keymap coordinator
    can process subsequently received keymap information read requests in the event
    an information placeholder is cached as the current cached keymap information.

  name: Balancing latency and throughput for shared resources
  summary: ""
  abstract: Input and output (I/O) operations performed by a data storage device are
    managed dynamically to balance aspects such as throughput and latency. Sequential
    read and write requests are sent to a data storage device whereby the corresponding
    operations are performed without time delay due to extra disk revolutions. In
    order to minimize latency, particularly for read operations, random read and write
    requests are held in a queue upstream of an I/O controller of the data storage
    device until the buffer of the data storage device is empty. The queued requests
    can be reordered when a higher priority request is received, improving the overall
    latency for specific requests. An I/O scheduler of a data server is still able
    to use any appropriate algorithm to order I/O requests, such as by prioritizing
    reads over writes as long as the writes do not back up in the I/O queue beyond
    a certain threshold.

  name: Dynamically migrating computer networks
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques are described for providing capabilities to dynamically migrate
    computing nodes between two or more computer networks while the computer networks
    are in use, such as to dynamically and incrementally migrate an entire originating
    first computer network to a destination second computer network at a remote location.
    For example, the first computer network may include one or more physically connected
    computer networks, while the second computer network may be a virtual computer
    network at a remote geographical location (e.g., under control of a network-accessible
    service available to remote users). The provided capabilities may further include
    facilitating the ongoing operations of the originating first computer network
    while a subset of the first computer network computing nodes have been migrated
    to the remote destination second computer network, such as by forwarding communications
    between the first and second computer networks in a manner that is transparent
    to the various computing nodes.

  abstract: Techniques are described for managing the execution of programs on multiple
    computing systems, such as computing systems organized into multiple groups. A
    program execution service manages the program execution on behalf of multiple
    customers or other users, and selects appropriate computing systems to execute
    one or more instances of program, such as based in part on locations of one or
    more previously stored copies of the program from which copies of the program
    to execute may be acquired. For example, in some situations the selection of an
    appropriate computing system to execute an instance of a program is based in part
    on physical or logical proximity to other resources, such as stored copies of
    the program, executing copies of the program, and/or available computing systems.

    automated validation criteria for tasks that they submit, and those specified
    validation criteria may automatically be used to determine whether results of
    performance of those tasks by task performers are validated. To facilitate such
    automated validation, predefined types of validation criteria may be provided
    that a user may select and/or configure. The outcome of automated validation of
    results may be used in various ways, such as to indicate when results have been
    validated and/or have not been validated, to determine whether to provide results
    to a task requester (e.g., if results are not provided unless they have been validated,
    or if results that fail validation are corrected or replaced with results that
    pass validation) and/or to compensate task performers for providing the results.

  name: Stateless packet segmentation and processing
  summary: ""
  abstract: High-speed processing of packets to, and from, a virtualization environment
    can be provided while utilizing segmentation offload and other such functionality
    of commodity hardware. Virtualization information can be added to extension portions
    of protocol headers, for example, such that the payload portion is unchanged and,
    when physical address information is added to a frame, a frame can be processed
    using commodity hardware. In some embodiments, the virtualization information
    can be hashed and added to the payload or stream at, or relative to, various segmentation
    boundaries, such that the virtualization or additional header information will
    only be added to a subset of the packets once segmented, thereby reducing the
    necessary overhead. Further, the hashing of the information can allow for reconstruction
    of the virtualization information upon desegmentation even in the event of packet
    loss.

  name: Streamlined guest networking in a virtualized environment
  summary: ""
  abstract: Networking speed in a virtualized environment can be improved by utilizing
    an enhanced protocol and parallel stack to bypass restrictions of a conventional
    network stack that complies with standard networking protocols. In one embodiment,
    an enhanced TCP protocol enables large packets received from a guest application
    to bypass the guest networking stack and be received to a bottom conversion layer
    of the enhanced stack, which is able to segment the packet into appropriately
    sized segments that conform to the conventional protocol. These segments can be
    passed to a network interface card (NIC) or other device for encapsulation, framing,
    or other such processing to be transmitted to the destination as Ethernet frames
    or other such packets.

  name: Dynamic isolation of shared resources
  summary: ""
  abstract: Shared resources can be isolated such that abuse of the resource by one
    user does not significantly affect the use of that resource by another user. A
    combination of access and flow control can be used, wherein a control gateway
    or other such component sits along a path between the user and the resource, such
    that the user obtains connections or access to the resource through the gateway.
    In this way, the gateway can control aspects such as the number of concurrent
    threads or channels granted to a user, as well as any delay in providing these
    threads or channels to the resource. A closed feedback loop can provide real-time
    information such that adjustments can be made dynamically, preventing abuse by
    users while also preventing the resource allocations from being underutilized.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Replicated instances in a database environment provide for automatic failover
    and recovery. A monitoring component can periodically communicate with a primary
    and a secondary replica for an instance, with each capable of residing in a separate
    data zone or geographic location to provide a level of reliability and availability.
    A database running on the primary instance can have information synchronously
    replicated to the secondary replica at a block level, such that the primary and
    secondary replicas are in sync. In the event that the monitoring component is
    not able to communicate with one of the replicas, the monitoring component can
    attempt to determine whether those replicas can communicate with each other, as
    well as whether the replicas have the same data generation version. Depending
    on the state information, the monitoring component can automatically perform a
    recovery operation, such as to failover to the secondary replica or perform secondary
    replica recovery.

  name: Providing executing programs with reliable access to non-local block data
    storage
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques are described for managing access of executing programs to
    non-local block data storage. In some situations, a block data storage service
    uses multiple server storage systems to reliably store block data that may be
    accessed over one or more networks by programs executing on other physical computing
    systems. Users may create block data storage volumes that are each stored by at
    least two of the server block data storage systems, and may initiate use of such
    volumes by one or more executing programs, such as in a reliable manner by enabling
    an automatic switch to a second volume copy if a first volume copy becomes unavailable.
    A group of multiple server block data storage systems that store block data volumes
    may in some situations be co-located at a data center, and programs that use volumes
    stored there may execute on other physical computing systems at that data center.

  name: Executing programs based on user-specified constraints
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques are described for managing execution of programs on multiple
    computing systems, such as based at least in part of user-specified constraints.
    For example, constraints related to execution of a program may be based on a desired
    relative location of a host computing system to execute a copy of the program
    with respect to an indicated target (e.g., computing systems executing other copies
    of the program or copies of another indicated program), on particular geographic
    locations, and/or on factors not based on location (e.g., cost of use of a particular
    computing system, capabilities available from a particular computing system, etc.).
    Some or all of the multiple computing systems may be part of a program execution
    service for executing multiple programs on behalf of multiple users, and each
    may provide multiple virtual machines that are each capable of executing one or
    more programs for one or more users.

  name: Providing an electronic marketplace to facilitate human performance of programmatically
    submitted tasks
  summary: ""
  abstract: A method, system, and computer-readable medium is described for facilitating
    interactions between task requesters who have tasks that are available to be performed
    and task performers who are available to perform tasks. In some situations, the
    tasks to be performed are human performance tasks that use cognitive and other
    mental skills of human task performers, such as to employ judgment, perception
    and/or reasoning skills of the human task performers. In addition, in some situations
    the available tasks are submitted by human task requesters via application programs
    that programmatically invoke one or more application program interfaces of an
    electronic marketplace in order to request that the tasks be performed and to
    receive corresponding results of task performance in a programmatic manner, so
    that an ensemble of unrelated human agents can interact with the electronic marketplace
    to collectively perform a wide variety and large number of tasks.

  summary: ""
  abstract: An electronic catalog system includes automated processes for detecting

    when a user engages in a threshold level of browsing activity with respect to
    an item without making a purchase of that item or a substitute item, and a favorable
    change in the item's state thereafter occurs (e.g., the price is reduced or the
    item becomes available), the user is automatically notified of the state change.
    In another embodiment, when a user transitions away from an item or item category
    after engaging in a threshold level of browsing activity, a determination is made
    whether to present to the user a time-limited purchase incentive that is tied
    to that item or item category.

  name: Method and system for managing access to media files
  summary: ""
  abstract: Access to selected content in different file formats can be managed by
    conducting, in a single purchase transaction, a user purchase of access rights
    that allow a user to acquire multiple copies of the same selected content in media
    files having different file formats. An authorization signal is communicated to
    a content provider or multiple content providers who did not conduct the purchase
    transaction. The authorization signal contains information that allows the content
    provider or the multiple content providers to authorize the user to acquire multiple
    copies of the same selected content in different file formats without requiring
    the user to conduct multiple transactions. Each copy of the selected content acquired
    from a content provider is in a media file having a different file format.

  name: Method and system for automated comparison of items
  summary: ""
  abstract: An automated method and system for providing an item comparison includes
    identifying a first item and a set of one or more other items for comparison with
    the first item, prioritizing attributes of the first item and the other items,
    and providing the item comparison with prioritized attributes to a user. Identifying
    comparable items may involve a multiple step process in which a candidate set
    of items is first selected for possible comparison with the first item, and thereafter
    selecting one or more items from the candidate set for comparison. Prioritizing
    the attributes of the items may include measuring like attributes of the items
    against each other and arranging the attributes to appear in an order according
    to the degree the like attributes distinguish the items from each other. A modified
    item comparison may be prepared and provided in accordance with user feedback.

  name: Method and system for occurrence frequency-based scaling of navigation path
    weights among online content sources
  summary: ""
  abstract: A method and system for scaling navigation path weights among online content
    sources. A method may include determining a first probability of users traversing
    a first navigation path from a first to a second online content source, dependent
    upon a ratio of traversals of the first navigation path and traversals of all
    navigation paths to the second online content source. The method may also include
    determining a second probability of users traversing navigation paths from the
    first online content source to any of the online content sources, dependent upon
    a ratio of the plurality of online content sources to which navigation paths from
    the first online content source exist and a total number of the plurality of online
    content sources. The method may further include generating from the probabilities
    a scaling factor indicative of a strength of the first navigation path relative
    to other navigation paths among the online content sources.

  name: Automatic authorization of programmatic transactions
  summary: ""
  abstract: Techniques are described for facilitating interactions between computing
    systems, such as via a third-party transaction authorization system that automatically
    authorizes transactions between parties. In some situations, the transactions
    are programmatic transactions involving the use of fee-based Web services by executing
    application programs, with the transaction authorization system authorizing and/or
    providing payments for transactions between Web service provider and consumer
    parties in accordance with private authorization instructions previously specified
    by the parties. The authorization instructions may include predefined instruction
    rule sets that regulate conditions under which a potential transaction can be
    authorized, with the instruction rule sets each referenced by an associated reference
    token. The transaction authorization system can then receive a reference token
    from each party to a potential transaction, and determine whether to authorize
    the transaction based on whether the instruction rule sets associated with the
    reference tokens are compatible or otherwise satisfied.

  name: Universal protocol for enabling a device to discover and utilize the services
    of another device
  summary: ""
  abstract: A method and apparatus for enabling any of a variety of devices to communicate
    with each other over a common or universal protocol. In general, a client device
    and a server device communicate with each other over a communications link utilizes
    the common protocol. Initially, once a communications link is established, the
    server device identifies itself to the client device by sending a tag line message
    over the communications link. Upon receiving the tag line message, the client
    then determines that the server is capable of using the common protocol. The client
    device may then initiate several requests including a service request, a type
    request or a use request. If the client device initiates a service request, the
    client simple uses the common protocol to request the service. In response to
    receiving the service request, the server device performs the requested service
    and provides a confirmation to the client device. If the client device initiates
    a type request, the service device will respond by providing information regarding
    the services the server device provides and the device types supported by the
    server device. If the client device initiates a use request for a particular service,
    the server device will provide information to the client device that describes
    the necessary parameters for invoking the particular service.
